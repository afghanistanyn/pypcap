Python pcap module
------------------

this is a simplified object-oriented Python wrapper for libpcap - both
the current tcpdump.org version, and the legacy version shipping with
some of the BSD operating systems.

if your libpcap installation is somewhere else, edit setup.py
appropriately. then just 'make' and 'make install'.

example use:

>>> import pcap
>>> def print_pkt(ts, pkt, arg):
...     print repr(pkt)
... 
>>> pc = pcap.pcap()
>>> pc.loop(print_pkt)

-d.
