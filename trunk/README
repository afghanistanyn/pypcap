Python pcap module
------------------

this is a simplified object-oriented Python wrapper for libpcap - both
the current tcpdump.org version, the legacy version shipping with some
of the BSD operating systems, and the WinPcap-3.x port for Windows.

if your libpcap installation is somewhere else, edit the Makefile
appropriately. then just 'make' and 'make install'.

example use:

>>> import pcap
>>> def print_pkt(ts, pkt, arg):
...     print repr(pkt)
... 
>>> pc = pcap.pcap()
>>> pc.loop(print_pkt)

-d.
